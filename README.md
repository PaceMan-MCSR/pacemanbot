# pacemanbot
A Discord bot to query paceman.gg, ping pace-roles and assign pace-roles to users.

# Usage
- Build the project with a `.env` file using `cargo build -r` (first compile takes long)
- A binary will be created in `target/release/` named `pacemanbot`.
- Run the binary and the bot should start running.

# Thanks
- [boyenn](https://github.com/dev-boyenn) for the initial implementation of the core with the Websockets backend.
